Prepare your images:

    Create a folder (e.g., "card_images") and put all your card images in it

    Images can be in PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, or BMP format

Run the script:

    Run from Command Prompt (Recommended)

    cd "C:\Users\user\Documents\script name"

    Run the script:

    python your_script_name.py

    (Replace your_script_name.py with your actual script filename)

    The default card size is 2.5" x 3.5" (standard poker size)
