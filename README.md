Prepare your images:

    Create a folder (e.g., "card_images") and put all your card images in it

    Images can be in PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, or BMP format

    The script will use the filenames to determine the order of cards

Run the script:

    Modify the input_folder and output_pdf variables at the bottom if needed
Run from Command Prompt (Recommended)

The best way to see errors is to run the script from Command Prompt:

    Open Command Prompt:

        Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.

    Navigate to your script's folder:
    cmd

cd "C:\Users\user\Documents\script name"

Run the script:
cmd

python your_script_name.py

(Replace your_script_name.py with your actual script filename)

    The default card size is 2.5" x 3.5" (standard poker size)

    The default DPI is 300 for high quality printing


Print the PDF:

    Print at actual size (100% scale)

    Use 110lb cardstock for best results
